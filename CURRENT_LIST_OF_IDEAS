- New database column for personal revive amount - !done gives a +1 to this column - anyone with appropriate permission (includes all members) can pull their own personal total. Means that manual tracking no longer needs to occur - all done by the bot!
- A way for the bot to assign people the Contract Faction role
  - A 'handshake' is the best suggestion I've heard so far - new user types !requestrole (or something like that), which sends a message      off to a separate channel, pinging the role Contract Faction Leader. The Contract Faction Leader can then !accept that user, with          !accept [Username] (or similar), completing the 'handshake'
- Need to write an embed for the bot to have in a landing page - explaining key bot elements, and driving users to documentation. Need to lead the horse to water! Embeds are easy of course, just need to muster the energy to actually do this...
- General purge command for channels - so that #setid and #rolemanagement can get cleaned on a regular basis by admins. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43037079/discord-net-1-0-how-to-get-messages-to-delete potentially? Might just be a copy-paste job)
- Specific purge for completed revives
  - !r / !cr creates a revive request, as per current. !done sends a flag (like currently as well) that says the revive is done. Then,       after 10 seconds (an amount of time generally), both the original request AND the !done flag are deleted. 
  - Potentially do a general purge of last 100 messages, looking for the ID used in !done?
- Change !r / !cr to direct revive link - efficiency ho!
- Way to manually set the total invoice number - for use in case of foul ups, or a need to add extra. Make them relatively 'secret' commands, for +1, -1, and setting to a specific number. Do database columns accept negative numbers? If so, using a specific user's Discord ID (probably Gaffer / Pricklykiller) would be good - since they're sticking around forever. If not, then a creative solution is needed re: the -1 - but the rest can be set to a specific Discord ID, using that as the dummy.
- Hook the Torn API? How to use effectively as opposed to just having it because it's cool - retaining the key invoice based measures that have been implemented? (Also, how the hell to do it in the first place?) Keeping the basic ideas of the invoice will be key - since it's the entire purpose of the bot existing!
